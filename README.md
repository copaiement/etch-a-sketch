## About
This webpage allows the user to draw on a pixel grid, similarly to an etch-a-sketch. This was created as part of TOP: Fundamentals.

## Goals
* Create a 16x16 pixel grid on a page
* When user mouses over a square in the grid, that square changes color
* Allow user to select color that the grid is being filled with
* Allow user to select size of grid up to 100x100
* Create multiple fill effects for squares (choose color, random, or shade)
* Create clear button to reset grid to white
* Allow user to toggle between "click" and "drag" modes to fill squares
